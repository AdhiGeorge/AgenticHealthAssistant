Patient presents with episodic chest pain and palpitations lasting 10-20 minutes, occurring 1-2 times weekly. Associated symptoms include shortness of breath, dizziness, and sweating. Normal cardiac investigations (ECG, echocardiogram, cardiac enzymes) suggest non-cardiac etiology.

**DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSES:**
1. Panic Disorder - Most likely given episodic nature and associated anxiety symptoms
2. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) - Patient has known GERD which can cause chest pain
3. Musculoskeletal chest pain - Less likely given episodic pattern
4. Cardiac ischemia - Ruled out by normal investigations
5. Arrhythmia - Ruled out by normal ECG and Holter monitoring

**SPECIFIC FINDINGS:**
- ECG: Normal sinus rhythm, no ischemia or arrhythmia
- Echocardiogram: Normal cardiac structure and function, EF 60%
- Cardiac enzymes: Within normal limits
- Holter monitor: Occasional PVCs, no significant arrhythmias

**TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS:**
- Continue current cardiac monitoring
- Address underlying anxiety/panic disorder
- Consider stress test if symptoms persist despite anxiety treatment
- Lifestyle modifications: stress reduction, regular exercise

**FOLLOW-UP PLAN:**
- Cardiology follow-up in 3 months if symptoms persist
- Immediate return if new cardiac symptoms develop
- Coordinate with psychiatry for anxiety management"""

Patient meets DSM-5 criteria for Panic Disorder with recurrent unexpected panic attacks. Symptoms include chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness, sweating, and fear of impending doom. History of anxiety disorder and family history of anxiety support diagnosis.

**DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSES:**
1. Panic Disorder - Primary diagnosis based on episodic panic attacks
2. Generalized Anxiety Disorder - Comorbid condition likely present
3. Cardiac condition - Ruled out by normal cardiac investigations
4. Hyperthyroidism - Ruled out by normal thyroid function tests
5. Substance-induced anxiety - Patient denies current substance use

**SPECIFIC FINDINGS:**
- Episodic panic attacks lasting 10-20 minutes
- Associated physical symptoms during attacks
- Fear of having a heart attack
- High-stress occupation as contributing factor
- Family history of anxiety disorder

**TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS:**
- Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for panic disorder
- Consider SSRI (e.g., Sertraline 50mg daily) for daily anxiety management
- Continue Lorazepam 0.5mg PRN for acute panic attacks
- Stress management techniques and lifestyle modifications
- Regular exercise and caffeine/alcohol reduction

**FOLLOW-UP PLAN:**
- Weekly psychiatric follow-up for first month
- Bi-weekly appointments for next 2 months
- Monthly appointments thereafter
- Monitor response to CBT and medication
- Assess for medication side effects"""

1. Anxiety-induced hyperventilation - Most likely given episodic nature
2. Panic disorder with respiratory symptoms - Primary diagnosis
3. Asthma - Less likely given normal breath sounds and episodic pattern
4. COPD - Ruled out by age and lack of risk factors
5. Pulmonary embolism - Ruled out by normal vital signs and episodic nature

**SPECIFIC FINDINGS:**
- Episodic shortness of breath during panic attacks
- Normal breath sounds on examination
- No wheezing or crackles
- Normal oxygen saturation
- No chronic respiratory symptoms

**TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS:**
- Address underlying panic disorder
- Breathing exercises for anxiety management
- No specific pulmonary treatment required
- Monitor for development of primary respiratory symptoms

**FOLLOW-UP PLAN:**
- Pulmonary follow-up only if primary respiratory symptoms develop
- Coordinate with psychiatry for anxiety management
